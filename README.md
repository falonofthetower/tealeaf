TeaLeaf exercises

These are the exercises from the introduction to programming book from http://www.gotealeaf.com/books. All the official answers can be found in the book (free) so just go there. If you are reviewing these you'll note that the same format wasn't used throughout mostly due to the loose nature of the questons. Much of it had more to do with creating muscle memory than something to be saved.
